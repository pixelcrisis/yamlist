# yamlist - *y*et *a*nother *m*edia list

Designed to be simple and used quickly. Primary focus? Removing the guesswork. Why suffer choosing through choosing what to put on? Leave it to fate. The luck of the draw. A roll of the dice. The flip of the coin. The...button...in the app...

We'll spin the wheel for you so you don't have to choose - and you can blame us instead of yourself.

## Installation

Project is still in a completely useless state. If you know what you're doing, you know what you're doing. More to come.

## Contributing

Opening a pull request or an issue is a good first move. It's always good to have your first meeting be in a public setting, and we can see if there's a spark between us.

## License

See **Installation**. Right now there's nothing. If you would like to steal my nothing, go ahead. This will be updated at a later date, so check back as I figure out what I want to even do with this project.
